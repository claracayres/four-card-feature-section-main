## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a solution to the Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to recreate a responsive layout showcasing four features, using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques like Grid and Flexbox.

The challenge helped me practice:

Creating responsive layouts that adapt well across screen sizes

Working with Grid to position elements precisely

Writing clean, maintainable CSS with custom properties

## ðŸš€ My Process

I started the project by analyzing the design provided by Frontend Mentor. I first created the HTML structure to make sure the layout was semantically correct and accessible.

After that, I moved on to styling:

Base styles â€“ I added global styles such as font-family, background color, and text alignment.

Mobile-first approach â€“ I built the mobile layout first using Flexbox for stacking and alignment.

Responsive layout with CSS Grid â€“ For the desktop view, I used CSS Grid to position the cards in a three-column layout with the middle two stacked.

Final refinements â€“ I adjusted spacing, colors, and font sizes to match the design as closely as possible.

Throughout the process, I paid special attention to keeping the CSS clean and reusable, and I tested the layout across different screen sizes.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

One of the main things I practiced in this challenge was combining CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a balanced, responsive layout. A key part was positioning the middle two cards vertically while keeping the outer cards centered between rows.

```css
.cards-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto auto;
  gap: 30px;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
